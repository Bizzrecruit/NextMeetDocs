Few Recent Use Cases of NextMeet®

ICFAI – Hyderabad
Mr Madhusudhan Rao – IT from ICFAI has organized a Masterclass on Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality using NextMeet® 3D meeting Platform

“First time this year that an e-meet didn’t leave me rubbing my eyes after it ended.”

“We’ve seen consultants in the past re-package traditional corporate team activities as ‘gamification’. NextMeet is the first real experience we’ve had where work is gamified.”

“When can we have this as a mobile app?”

“Hadn’t ever realized our video conferences had a severe audio handicap. It’s hard to go back to the old world after NextMeet®.”

“NextMeet® is the missing step between ‘remote work’ and ‘productive remote work’.”

Of the 25 students and faculty members from IFCAI Business School who experienced the NextMeet demo, everyone joined the session a skeptic and left it a believer.

The triple whammy of fully-immersive 3D workspace, avatarization, and spatial audio can be overwhelming and fascinating at the same time. So it was for us, because it was our first full-scale demo with an external organization.

The 3 use cases that the IFCAI thinktank was most excited about are:

NextMeet as a digital simulation of the university, as a network of virtual classrooms. 

NextMeet as a virtual exhibition space for education fairs.

NextMeet as a virtual workspace for the faculty of the university.

Michigan State University

Dr. Linda Nubani stated , “This is the first time since the pandemic that I was able to connect with my students in a way similar to in-person classes.” Nubani added “i can see great potentials of using this platform in many areas. More importantly, i felt that the environment does not descriminate you because of your ethnicity, age, gender or skin color. We can all be heard and the environment motivates you to do so”
